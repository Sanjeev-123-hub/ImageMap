    <h1>Padmaneri</h1>
    <p>The Padma (Bengali: পদ্মা, romanized: Pôdmā) is a major river in Bangladesh. It is the eastern and main distributary of the Ganges, flowing generally southeast for 356 kilometres (221 mi) to its confluence with the Meghna River, near the Bay of Bengal.[1] The city of Rajshahi is situated on the banks of the river.[3] Since 1966, over 66,000 hectares of land have been lost to erosion of the Padma.[4]</p>
